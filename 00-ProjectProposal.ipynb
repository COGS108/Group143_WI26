    "The purpose of animal shelters in the United States (U.S.) is to serve as a temporary place for animals to have a safe place to live while they wait for permanent homes. Humans can visit shelters, adopt an animal, and bring it home to care for. However, over the past decade, shelters have been overburdened and overcrowded, leading to many animals being euthanised [1, 2]. More specifically, 11.5% of dogs were euthanized in 2025 [2]. Dogs, in particular, require more human interaction, emphasizing the urgent need to study these species. The longer a dog stays in a shelter, the more likely they are to exhibit stress-related behaviors, such as aggression, which can reduce the likelihood of adoption [3]. Furthermore, dogs are active animals, and being confined to small spaces for long periods of time can be detrimental to their health [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to reduce the number of dogs euthanised is to increase the adoption rate. To do so, we aim to identify the best predictors to increase the likelihood of adoption. In a literature review, researchers identified the most common predictive factors affecting an animal’s adoption rate, including animal type, breed, color, gender, age, location, and length of stay [3]. Previous literature identified age, size, and color as the strongest predictive factors in a dog’s length of stay [5]. Other researchers found that age is a strong predictor of adoption, with younger dogs at intake in the shelter more likely to be adopted. Older dogs were more frequently taken in at the animal shelters [2, 6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study focuses on shelters in the U.S., particularly in Austin, Texas; Sonoma, California; Louisville, Kentucky; and Bloomington, Indiana. According to PetFinder data, Texas has the highest rate of dog exports because shelters there cannot support the number of dogs without homes [7]. California has a medium-to-high level of exported dogs. Kentucky has a medium size of exported dogs, and Indiana has among the lowest rates of exported dogs. We wanted to explore the range of exported dogs based on animal shelter capacity to ensure we captured a diverse set of locations and shelter capacities. \n",

    "1. We hypothesize that younger dogs and dogs without medical conditions will have a higher probability of adoption than older dogs and dogs with medical conditions. Alternatively, there could be no significant difference between age and medical condition and adoption rates, which would support the null hypothesis. \n",
    "2. Additionally, we expect longer stays in shelters to be associated with lower adoption probabilities, as dogs that stay in shelters for long periods may face increased behavioral and health challenges. \n",
    "3. We expect these patterns to hold even when comparing dogs of similar breeds and intake conditions. \n"

    "1. Our ideal dataset would include an outcome variable: adopted, transferred, or euthanized, along with the predictor variables: age at intake, sex, breed, health condition at intake, and coat color. It would also include intake and shelter context variables: intake type (stray, surrender, confiscation, etc.), intake date, length of stay at the shelter, shelter capacity, and shelter location. To build a well-thought-out predictive model, the dataset should include several thousand dog records from different locations across the United States, ideally spanning multiple years, to ensure adequate representation and better generalization. Our data would ideally be stored in a CSV file, where each row represents one dog’s intake record and each column represents a variable. This structure would allow for efficient cleaning, merging, and analysis.\n",

    "This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle, and we downloaded it directly as a CSV file without needing permission. Some important variables we would use for this dataset include intake characteristics (type, condition, and date) and outcomes (adopted, transferred, or euthanized). We would also use variables such as the dog’s demographics, including breed, age, and sex. There is also a separate intake dataset, which we will merge with the outcomes dataset on the animal_id field to improve modeling.\n",

    "## Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no human subjects involved in this project. The datasets consist solely of information about dogs in animal shelters, so informed consent from human participants is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection bias is present in several ways. Most stray dogs entering shelters are adults, and age is often estimated rather than known, which can reduce accuracy. Additionally, each dataset is collected by different shelters or organizations, and there is no standardized data collection process across states or cities. This inconsistency may introduce bias and recording errors that affect comparability across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used do not contain personally identifiable information. All variables pertain to the animals themselves (e.g., age, breed, intake type), and no identifying information about individuals who surrendered or found the animals is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "While protected human attributes are not applicable, we acknowledge that variables such as breed, size, and age may act as proxies that influence outcomes like adoption or length of stay. We plan to interpret results carefully and explicitly discuss these limitations when analyzing and presenting findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used are publicly available and do not contain sensitive or personal information. Data will be stored locally in secured personal devices and course-approved platforms, following standard academic data-handling practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the datasets do not include personal information about individuals, the right to be forgotten is not applicable in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be retained only for the duration of the course project and deleted afterward, consistent with standard academic practices for coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize several blindspots in the data. Breed and age information may be inaccurate due to lack of reliable records, and intake reasons may be misreported (e.g., owners labeling surrendered dogs as strays). Additionally, a substantial portion of intake data is missing, which may limit the validity of certain conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias may arise from subjective classification of breed, size, age, and health status. Dogs may appear healthy upon intake but later be diagnosed with medical conditions, altering their classification. Missing data and misclassification are acknowledged and will be discussed as limitations in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to create visualizations and summary statistics that accurately reflect the data, including clearly indicating missing values, skewed distributions, and uncertainty where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets analyzed include only information about dogs and do not contain PII. As a result, privacy concerns related to individuals are minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "All data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis steps will be documented in code and written explanations, allowing the analysis to be reproduced and reviewed if issues arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables such as breed and size may act as proxies due to subjective classification by shelter staff. For example, dogs perceived as “mean-looking” may be mislabeled as pit bulls, and mixed breeds are especially difficult to identify accurately. These issues are acknowledged as potential sources of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested\n",
